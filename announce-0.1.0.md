## Repo Find Orphans 0.1.1 Released!

This release introduces a new feature: [**remote orphan detection**](https://github.com/vladistan/repo-find-orphans/tree/v0.1.1?tab=readme-ov-file#finding-remote-orphans).  Now you can use `repo-find-orphans` to find repositories on GitHub that are not included in your repo manifest. This is useful for discovering repositories where you collaborate but are not monitored by your repo project.

The version 0.1.1 introduces breaking changes to the CLI interface, see [documentation](https://github.com/vladistan/repo-find-orphans/tree/v0.1.1?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) for details.
